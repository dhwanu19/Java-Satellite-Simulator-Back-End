# Java Satellite Simulator Back End

## Overview

This project is a simplified simulation designed for the COMP2511 course, focusing on the representation of a ring and its rotating satellites around Jupiter. The primary objective of this project was to create and maintain connections between satellites and devices, leveraging the power of Java and JSON for effective data handling.

## Duration

This project was completed over the course of 1 month and was undertaken individually.

## Role

As the sole developer of the "Back in Blackout" project, my responsibilities spanned the entire software development lifecycle, from conceptualization to implementation. This comprehensive role required a multi-faceted skill set, including design, programming, testing, and debugging. Key aspects of my role included:

- **Project Planning and Design:** Initiated the project with thorough planning, involving requirements analysis and the formulation of a clear development strategy. Designed the system architecture focusing on modularity, scalability, and efficient data management.
- **Software Development:** Implemented the core logic using Java, adhering to best practices in object-oriented programming. Developed robust classes for devices and satellites, ensuring clean code and optimal performance.
- **Data Handling and Integration:** Utilized JSON for representing the dynamic world state and developed mechanisms for parsing JSON data, integrating it seamlessly with the simulation logic.
- **Simulation Testing and Debugging:** Conducted comprehensive testing to identify and rectify bugs, ensuring the simulation ran smoothly and met project requirements.
- **Documentation and Reporting:** Maintained detailed documentation throughout the development process, including code comments and development logs.
- **Performance Optimization:** Continuously monitored and optimized the simulation's performance to improve efficiency and reduce computational overhead.
- **Collaboration and Communication:** Engaged with course instructors and peers for feedback, refining the project's objectives and outcomes.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Main programming language for developing the simulation logic and for applying object-oriented design principles.
- **JSON:** Used for representing the world state, including the configuration of devices and satellites, as well as their dynamic interactions.

## Key Contributions

- **Systematic Design Approach:** Employed a methodical approach to object-oriented design, focusing on principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, composition, and inheritance.
- **Implementation of Interacting Classes:** Created multiple interacting classes to accurately represent devices, satellites, and their behaviors within the simulation environment.
- **Java Libraries:** Utilized Java libraries to effectively manage and manipulate data structures.
- **JSON Handling:** Implemented JSON to depict the world states, facilitating the dynamic connection and disconnection of devices based on satellite visibility.

## Project Outcomes

- Successfully developed and executed a simulation that maintained connections between devices and satellites, considering their positions, activation periods, and visibility.
- Demonstrated the ability to independently achieve complex programming objectives, fulfilling all project requirements within the set timeline.
- Enhanced understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and their application in real-world challenges.
- Achieved a perfect grade of 40/40, reflecting the project's excellence and achievement of all objectives.
